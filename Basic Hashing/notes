Hashing is done using several methods. Among them, the three most common ones are
    Division method
    Folding method
    Mid-Square method
-----------------------------------
Time complexity of 
    Mop: 
        Best Case:O(Log n)
        Average Case:O(Log n)
        Worst Case:O(Log n)
    Unordered Map:
        Best Case:O(1)
        Average Case:O(1)
        Worst Case:O(N)
-------------------------------------
Our first priority will be always to use unordered_map and then map.
The time complexity in the worst case is O(N) because of the internal collision.
